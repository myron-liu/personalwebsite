# Personal Website
Repository for my personal website. My name is Myron Liu and my website can be found at myronliu.me

It is a simple Node.js server written with Express and a SQL backend for keeping website logging metrics. It is hosted on heroku free tier. Let me know if you find any typos or any ways I could improve my website.
